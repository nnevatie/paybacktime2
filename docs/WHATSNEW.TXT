  ************************************************************************

- 3 gamemodes.
        + Classic: The one used in the ancient PT.
        + Realistic: Once you have seen the place, it is always remembered. 
        + Extreme-Reality: 'What you'll see is all you'll get'.
                           (Better know the map beforehand)

- Lighting is now supported.
        + Adjustable ambient light 
        + Lighting affects shooting, visibility and atmosphere.
        + It's fun to create maps with bizarre lighting.
        + Lights can be shot at.
        + Flares can be bought in the group editor.

- Computer players added         
        + 4 skill levels:
                Ridiculous  - For absolute beginners
                Easy        - The name says everything
                Average     - For average people    
                Challenging - The choice of a true warrior
        + Here in our labs, only CHALLENGING is used, though.

- Up to 4 players can now get into the action simultaneously. 
        + We have also created a join-option for those who want to get fair
          in 3 vs. 1 battles... (Human-players can join cpu-players too)

- The limit of 10 warriors/team in battle has been removed.
        + All 20 warriors of the team can now join the battle.

- Deployment areas have been implemented.
        + No more fixed places for each warrior.
        + Allows much more complex tactical manouvers.

- Warriors will now report if any enemy warriors were seen during the last
  defensive part of the turn.
        + The feature can be disabled. 
          (This is for you who liked the old PT-system better.)

- Critical and severe hits have been implemented.
        + 50-100% more damage can be done.
        + These are very rare, especially severe hits.

- Melee backstabbing has been implemented.
        + The attacker gains bonuses when attacking melee from behind.

- Stuff can be in found drawers.
        + The possibility can be adjusted in the mapeditor.

- Trapping doors 
        + This sport is for you who prefer defensive methods instead 
          of brutal, offensive tactics.
        + Traps can also be disarmed (with the possibility of failure, 
          of course.)

- Game-system algorithms have been rewritten and optimized. 
        + Very fast bi-directional line-of-sight routines guarantee 
          LOS for both the aimer and the target.
        + Interpolative lightblender is used to create smoother sceneries.
        + A major bugger found in the used compiler directives,
          the hardware FPU-calculation was disabled. As it is currently 
          enabled, the heavy explosives don't take a year to compute.

- Graphics have been improved.
        + Lots of graphics have been re-drawn as they were out of date.
          (The warriors, for instance).

- Helpscreen
        + For beginners.

- Music in the game
        + To add some audio-pleasure.

- Endstatistics
        + Who did and what. 
        + More glory for the thriumphant.
        + Extra-humiliation for the losers.

- ...And about 20833 other minor improvements, which make the game worth 
     dying for.
